      We are engaged in fundamental research in the fields of computer vision
      and machine learning, with a specific focus on applications in healthcare.
      Our research spans various interdisciplinary areas, including autism
      research, mobile health, and robotics. The study of human social and
      cognitive behavior is a common thread that ties our work together. Our
      primary objectives include the development of innovative techniques for
      behavior measurement in real-life settings, as well as the creation of
      computational models linking health-related behaviors to health outcomes.
      These endeavors are aimed at facilitating novel forms of treatment in the
      healthcare domain. Additionally, we are actively involved in the creation
      of machine learning methods inspired by child development and the
      exploration of biologically-inspired approaches to robot navigation and
      control.
