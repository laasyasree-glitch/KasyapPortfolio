        We are engaged in fundamental research in the fields of computer vision
        and machine learning, with a specific focus on applications in
        healthcare.

        The study of human social and cognitive behavior is a common thread that
        ties our work together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our primary objectives include the development of innovative techniques
        for behavior measurement in real-life settings, as well as the creation
        of computational models linking health-related behaviors to health
        outcomes.
      </li>
      <li>
        These endeavors are aimed at facilitating novel forms of treatment in
        the healthcare domain. Additionally, we are actively involved in the
        creation of machine learning methods inspired by child development and
        the exploration of biologically-inspired approaches to robot navigation
        and control.
